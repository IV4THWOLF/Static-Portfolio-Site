    <h1>About Devon Lowery</h1>

    <p>I began my journey as an artist around the age of 15. I started with photo composits, then created a playbook for a high school play. <br>
    Someone suggested that I should go to school for graphic design and since I enjoyed producing art, I did. I graduated from <i>Morgan State University</i><br>
    with my Bachelor's of Arts in Photography and Graphic Design in 2014. I majored in graphic design until halfway through my degree. <br>
    I took my first photography course and fell in love with the process of photography. Looking back, it's ironically funny how everything has <br />
    interweaved together. I got into my first role as a technician a month before I graduated from Morgan. There were so many times I was asked <br />
    "How did you get into cars if you studied art?" Cars were my main subject of my art, from photography, to printmaking, and, soon, design.<br />
    I feel like I'm late to the party when it comes to designing something for a vehicle. For some reason, it never crossed my mind although <br />
    I loved the interior, exterior, and the dashboard of cars.</p>

    <p>I started freelancing in 2012 under the name <i>Artist DTL</i>. And I've learned so much about business in so many different aspects just <br />
    freelancing alone. From providing pleasant experiences for clients, to marketing, to ensuring you protect yourself as best as you can with <br />
    wording through contracts. As far as the automotive field, I wanted to learn as much as I possibly could about repairing and modifying <br />
    cars. I started with my brakes on my personal car, then replaced the engine when it overheated and something was wrong with the block. <br />
    This lead to many opportunities from working as a technician, an auto body tech, and a detailer. I eventually got to the point where <br />
    I was doing electrical and IT work for the Baltimore County Government. From there, I transitioned to the transit industry working for <br />
    the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA). I had another opportunity to perform electrical and IT work through Vontas. And it was an <br />
    journey. Throughout my years in the automotive and transit field, I learned how to weld, do all kinds of repairs, edit some parts <br />
    of software if it was really necessary, and learned how to detail and paint correction.</p>

    <p>Although my journey in the automotive field as been great, I'm no longer passionate about being a technician. My love for the arts <br />
    never died. Actually, it became greater as time passed. So I'm advancing my career to the next level by relearning and expanding my skills <br />
    in front end development. My goal is to become a Full Stack Developer. Just to increase my knowledge in various fields, I obtained a certificate <br />
    in the Foundations of User Experience (UX) Design from Google and took post-grad business courses. When it comes to design, I want to be <br />
    as knowledgeable as possible in various areas including marketing, data analytics, and software development. Great designs occurs at the <br />
    intersection of being aesthetically pleasing and technical precision. This includes knowing your audience and market trends. I'm going to <br />
    specialize in the front end development (visual design) but be knowledgeable of other areas that interweave with the design as a whole.</p>
