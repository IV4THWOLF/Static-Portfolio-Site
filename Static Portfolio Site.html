		Hi, my name is Devon Lowery and welcome to my coding site. I am currently building this site solely through Visual Studio.<br>
		To visit my online visual art portfolio, please click <em><a target="_blank" href="https://www.devonlowery.com">here</a></em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am using this as a journal to talk about many things I enjoy and increase my skills as an individual. After studying<br>
		different art forms for years and submerging myself in as many parts of the automotive industry as possible, I'm transitioning<br>
		careers to cybersecurity with the goal to eventually become an Full Stack Developer.
